# Nightmare-Alarm-Clock
It's an alarm clock that will make you wish you will never wake up

This state of the art technology uses a microphone to detect spikes in sound to activate a set of two servos that sit on your lite switch. The servos will repeatedly switch the light on and off to help you wake up in the most horrifying way possible.
Because we need big spikes in sound to activate this system you will need a very loud alarm clock sound. I have designed the loudest and most horrifying 40~ second sound file that will ensure the activation of the alarm clock and also ensure long lasting psychological damage.

attached bellow is an unlisted YouTube video that will demonstrate the horror this machine can cause on even an inanimate object such as a pillow with a face drawn on it.

This has been one of the most if not the most enjoyable coding / crafting project I have done in maybe forever and was a great deal of fun. It was not a massive challenge but an enjoyable one nonetheless.
